- Hovering over a game name that is too long in the suggestions list will expand it, and when mouse leaves the area it will go back to hiding the overflow
- Made a validation in the create that checks if a game is released or not yet, and also returns an error message saying so if it isn't

- Added DLC searching functionality
- You can now select which search method, games or dlc, via radio buttons
- Clicking on the game or dlc radio buttons will also refresh the search bar with the results for that search type, if any are to be found
- All other minor flair things like 'game added' vs 'dlc added' has been added too
- Adding game and dlc filter funcitonality in the owned games page can come next

- Fixed a bug due to my misunderstanding of how event listeners worked for radio buttons. How it was coded before, when you clicked on the label for games or dlcs, it would trigger the event listener for clicking on a radio button twice, because the event listener was attached to the label, not the radio button itself. Moving the event listener only to the radio button would trigger the callback once whether you click on the label or the radio button. The previous bug resulted in the search dropdown list not populating correctly (sometimes dlc for games, and vice versa)


12/31

- Refactored some styling code
  - The games list container element now rests below the header and scrolls well. Dragging a game also can move the screen down so you can move the game cards anywhere in the container without having to let go and scroll down first
- Added holding key down functionality to the dropdown list logic, rather than just having to press the key each time to select a new element.

- Added Users table
- Created associations between all current tables
- CRUD operations by user now works, but account features are not implemented. Only for testing purposes at the moment
- Refactored a lot of code to make this happen, mostly in the OwnedGames controller
- A lot of migrations for adding and removing were made for redundant code


1/01

- Created playlist and playlist_game models as well as all associated associations for them

- Created the form for new playlist entry fully using just JS. No form submit and database posting functionality yet

- Playlist creation now works
- Created logic for checking if a user actually owns the id before something is deleted or updated
  - I realised that with how it is set up, a user can just change the data-id on an element and delete that id, even if it isn't their game. Given that is a major issue, had to find a way to stop that from happening, which was simply to just see if user_id of the game matches the session user (which is just hardcoded for now)
  - There has to be significantly more verification
  - This will obviously need to change when it becomes not user ids but tokens or however it works
  - Still need to put a message showing if the deletion was unsuccessful
    - Should also do for update failures and order updates
    - Requires lots of rendering responses


1/02
- Created error messages and changed the layout of a form slightly (mostly widened and some class changes)
  - Unsure if the button sizes at the bottom should be full width of the form or smaller. Currently col-4
- Error messages are now removed upon submission of a form (should a previous one fail)
  - Have to consider if I put a success message for completion or a dropdown box from the top (if not redirecting)

- Changed the remove buttons on owned games to btn-danger rather than primary
  - Not sure if it's good yet
- There is now a popup div which lets you know if an operation was CRUD'd successfully or not, but not for all operations at the moment
  - Will have to go along and see which operations it should be used for
- Fixed errors for stats bar logic where if the last game in owned games was deleted, the bar colour would not reset to 0

- Created most functionality, including page layout, for the playlist page
- Can currently add games to playlist
  - Renders error and success messages based on the result
- Games are not displayed yet in the "games in this playlist" section

- Finalised layout for the playlist page major sections
- Added ordering to playlists and playlist_games
  - Creating a new entry now correctly puts in order
- You can now scroll down the individual sections of the playlists if it is longer than the screen height
- Added game display in the playlist and add game section
- Added ordering entry into the database
  - No updating yet with SortableJS
- Decided to render the playlist updating and creation without redirecting/refreshing the page for best UE
- Added logic for changing between playlists
- Filter logic for games in a playlist taken out of the add games list works
- Clicking on a playlist will now also renders the sections with their respective games, and will also let you add to different playlists this way (no removal from a playlist functionality yet)


1/03
- Fixed an error where clicking on the remove button on a playlist game deletes the game from the library
  - This was due to the action being there and form.preventDefault() had not been put in
- Removing game from a playlist now works, but needs a refresh to update the dom still
  - Next will be to update the dom with JS to show changes
- Made removing game functionality functional. Removing a game from a playlist now not only removes the game from the games in this playlist section, but also puts it back in the add games to this playlist section
  - Inserts it to the correct order too
