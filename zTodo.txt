- Add completion rate stats on the playlist tab

- Add playlist auto completion

- Add sort_by stuff for owned_games list

- Add sort_by stuff for add_playlist_games list

- Edit playlist details

- Change the colour of the selected playlist to look better and different from the hover

- Types of playlists
  - Add model and schema stuff
  - How to enforce people to actually stick to their goals
  - Ongoing games vs games that can be completed etc
  - Start games from scratch playlist
    - Completed and started needs to be unticked for this playlist ONLY
    - Maybe a new table for just games that fit this condition?


- Figure out how to have the vertical lines on the playlist page go all the way down the page rather than stopping at the border of the last element



- Find out how to use strong params when you may need to add things to the params
  - Pretty much how do you add to params is the question

** Way down the line
- Refactor everything
- How to use data attributes without them being seen really, or more so refactor them all so there's no vulnerabilities with user injections
  - Is it even possible for them to do so without directly accessing the database?
- Custom confirm popup for confirmation requests like deletion
- Decide if I want to have confirmation message for owned game deletion
  - Could make a selection tool to delete multiple games at once instead so the confirmation message isn't so bad?
- Preload images
  - Needed if images take a while to load, as the cards will increase in size when the image is loaded, and they should all be loaded together
- Add drag and drop from add_playlist_games to the actual playlist, and be able to insert them in order
- Look into memory leaks

1/03
- Tested destruction of all records associated to a user when a user is destroyed
- Add deletion from playlist
  - This should add it back to the add games list in the correct order
- Add playlist ordering via SortableJS
- Add delete button for playlist
  - Delete, not remove, as you create the playlist yourself
- Dom content is fully updated dynamically with user interactions now (creating, sorting, and deleting playlists, and adding and removing games from playlists)
- Added sorting to playlist games
- Add logic for games in the playlist to have completion and started boxes ticked when being put in the playlist

1/02
- Error messages for playlist creation
  - Currently name conflict and creation errors only
  - Error messages are removed upon resubmission of a form
- Remove buttons are now red
- Created a popup div for whether a game was crud'd successfully or not
- Error messages for update and deleting failures
- Added scrolling capabilities for playlist sections
- Added add game functionality to playlists
- Added ordering entry into the database
  - Not actually functioning since nothing is displayed yet though
- Decide whether or not I want the page to refresh or not when I create a playlist
  - Not refreshing means I have to create an element containing the details of that playlist and all associated associations
  - May be easier to just refresh it
  - ** not refreshing in the end
- Display playlists on the playlist page
- Added logic for changing between playlists and adding event listeners for such
  - No displaying for anything other than the default playlist yet though
- Filter logic for games in a playlist taken out of the add games list works
- Clicking on a playlist will now also refresh the sections with their respective games, and will also let you add to different playlists this way
- Refresh playlist games and add games list when clicking on a new playlist
