- Refresh playlist games and add games list when clicking on a new playlist

- Add deletion from playlist
  - This should add it back to the add games list in the correct order


- Add completion rate stats on the playlist tab

- Add playlist ordering and auto completion



- Change the colour of the selected playlist

- Types of playlists
  - Add model and schema stuff
  - How to enforce people to actually stick to their goals

- Look into memory leaks

- Preload images
  - Needed if images take a while to load, as the cards will increase in size when the image is loaded, and they should all be loaded together
- Couple with moving all the page loading logic to the frontend

- Figure out how to have the vertical lines on the playlist page go all the way down the page rather than stopping at the border of the last element


Done:

1/02
- Error messages for playlist creation
  - Currently name conflict and creation errors only
  - Error messages are removed upon resubmission of a form
- Remove buttons are now red
- Created a popup div for whether a game was crud'd successfully or not
- Error messages for update and deleting failures
- Added scrolling capabilities for playlist sections
- Added add game functionality to playlists
- Added ordering entry into the database
  - Not actually functioning since nothing is displayed yet though
- Decide whether or not I want the page to refresh or not when I create a playlist
  - Not refreshing means I have to create an element containing the details of that playlist and all associated associations
  - May be easier to just refresh it
  - ** not refreshing in the end
- Display playlists on the playlist page
- Added logic for changing between playlists and adding event listeners for such
  - No displaying for anything other than the default playlist yet though
- Filter logic for games in a playlist taken out of the add games list works
- Clicking on a playlist will now also refresh the sections with their respective games, and will also let you add to different playlists this way
