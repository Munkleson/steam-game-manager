- Error messages for update and deleting failures

  - Decide whether or not I want the page to refresh or not when I create a playlist
    - Not refreshing means I have to create an element containing the details of that playlist and all associated associations
    - May be easier to just refresh it

- Display playlists on the playlist page

- Add games to playlists

- Display playlist games on their page







- Look into memory leaks

- Preload images
  - Needed if images take a while to load, as the cards will increase in size when the image is loaded, and they should all be loaded together
- Couple with moving all the page loading logic to the frontend


Done:

1/02
- Error messages for playlist creation
  - Currently name conflict and creation errors only
  - Error messages are removed upon resubmission of a form
- Remove buttons are now red
- Created a popup div for whether a game was crud'd successfully or not
