# README

This is my Rails app made to practice CRUD operations.

"Search steam games quickly without the server load that the steam app has"
"Manage and track your Steam games, and set solid goals to play games that you own but have never touched before!"

API source: https://steamapi.xpaw.me/#IStoreService

How to entice people to commit to gamess
prompt someone every time they log on
force the stats in their face
- Don't make it 1% of the screen
Link to steam account, which will rake your games
Change the search function to search for games you. may want to buy or something
Sort by last played and not completed etc
- Displayed last played and total hours too
Set your threshold in settings for whenn you consider a game to have been "played"
Compare achievements with friends
Better steam store searching
Ignore games
- Ignore dlcs for ignored games
Hide games in library
Mark as will never play
Run games from steam
- steam://run/#{appid}
Show discounts for games you own even
- For gifting to friends
Check if there are new dlcs for games you own
Save the current order of games in case you want to revert


Maybe the app could be a completionists app

Refresh stats when they log into the app
- Or whenever they check into a different page
- Cooldown on this stat checking, maybe 30 mins or an hour, otherwise it might call api too often
Check if there are changes in playtime to any games
- Check achievements for only those games to see if they've changed in numbers
- Play random game
- Search games to add on playlist
  - List your device specs and see what you can play


Sort_by

- Played time (most)
- Played time (least)
- Last played (oldest)
- Last played (newest)
- Alphabetical order

Change:
- "Played" to probably remove it complete
- Put in played time
- Add "hide game" to owned games
- Add "will never play" to owned games


Make a landing page for when people log out
Landing page includes
- Features link
- Guide?
- Privacy policy etc
- Header
  - Login button
Black background for the title part
links below that div for the included links
