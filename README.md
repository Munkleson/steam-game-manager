# README

This is my Rails app made to practice CRUD operations.

API source: https://steamapi.xpaw.me/#IStoreService

How to entice people to commit to gamess
prompt someone every time they log on
force the stats in their face
- Don't make it 1% of the screen
Link to steam account, which will rake your games
Change the search function to search for games you. may want to buy or something
Sort by last played and not completed etc

Maybe the app could be a completionists app

Refresh stats when they log into the app
- Or whenever they check into a different page
- Cooldown on this stat checking, maybe 30 mins or an hour, otherwise it might call api too often
Check if there are changes in playtime to any games
- Check achievements for only those games to see if they've changed in numbers


Sort_by

- Played time (most)
- Played time (least)
- Last played (oldest)
- Last played (newest)
- Alphabetical order

Change:
- "Played" to probably remove it complete
- Put in played time
- Add "hide game" to owned games


Make a landing page for when people log out
Landing page includes
- Features link
- Guide?
- Privacy policy etc
- Header
  - Login button
Black background for the title part
links below that div for the included links
